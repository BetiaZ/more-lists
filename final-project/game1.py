# - have checkpoints where you can rest
# - can die of starvation, disease, or drowning
# - can hunt (random pounds of food), set how many miles you want to go per day
# - goal: get to the end in the shortest number of days possible
# - random factors: lose clothes in river, bad weather delays, food spoils, find food or abandoned supplies
#checkpoint 2: nothing, can build a shelter? possibly
#c3: store again
#c4: river- if you choose the wrong option, (i.e., you realize that you don't know how to swim) you DIE
#c5: you're alive! if you have enough money left, you can take the boat home, if you don't, you realize you will have to survive on the island for eternity
